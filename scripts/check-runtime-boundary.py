"""
Runtime/Editor boundary guard for the Godot-MCP addon.

Godot compiles the WHOLE addon into one assembly, but the editor-only surface is stripped
from an exported game build because the editor `TOOLS` compilation symbol is undefined for
the `ExportDebug`/`ExportRelease` configurations (it is defined only for the editor `Debug`
config). The addon's source is organised so that everything which must SHIP into a game
(`GodotMcpRuntime.Initialize()` + the runtime-safe tools) lives under
`addons/godot_mcp/Runtime/`, and everything editor-only (the `EditorPlugin`, the dock UI,
and the editor tool families) lives under `addons/godot_mcp/Editor/`.

This script enforces the one rule that keeps that split honest:

    NO file under addons/godot_mcp/Runtime/ may reference an editor-only Godot API in
    code that actually compiles into a game build.

Concretely it FAILS (exit 1) when a `Runtime/**/*.cs` file, OUTSIDE comments, contains:

  * a real `EditorInterface` / `EditorPlugin` / `EditorFileSystem` / `EditorScript`
    reference that is NOT inside a `#if TOOLS` ... #endif guard, OR
  * a `#if TOOLS` guard that is not immediately closed (i.e. it would gate real code) —
    runtime code SHOULD be unconditional; a `#if TOOLS` block in Runtime/ is allowed only
    as a narrow, documented editor-coupling shim (see GodotMcpConnection.cs) and is reported
    as a WARNING, not a failure, because the guarded body is stripped from the game build.

The check is comment-aware: editor type names mentioned in `//` / `///` / `/* */`
documentation (which the addon's runtime files use heavily to EXPLAIN the boundary) never
trip the guard — only real code does. This mirrors exactly what the ExportRelease compile
strips, but runs in milliseconds with no .NET build, so it is cheap to gate every PR on.

Usage:
    python scripts/check-runtime-boundary.py            # scan, exit 1 on any violation
    python scripts/check-runtime-boundary.py --verbose  # also print the WARNING shims

Exit codes: 0 = boundary holds, 1 = at least one hard violation found.

    `/* */` block comments, AND string literals (regular `"..."`, verbatim `@"..."`, and the
    text spans of interpolated `$"..."`) — replacing them with spaces while preserving
    newlines so reported line numbers stay accurate.

    Why strings too: the addon's runtime files mention editor type names heavily, both in
    doc-comments AND inside `[Description("... EditorInterface.IsPlayingScene() ...")]`
    attribute strings, to DOCUMENT the boundary. Those are not real editor-API references —
    only an unquoted, uncommented `EditorInterface`/`EditorPlugin`/... token is. Blanking
    comments and string contents leaves exactly the real code for the token scan, matching
    what the ExportRelease compile actually strips.

    This is a deliberately small, single-purpose scanner — not a full C# lexer — but it
    handles the constructs this addon uses (line/block comments, regular/verbatim/raw-adjacent
    interpolated strings, escaped quotes, doubled `""` in verbatim strings)."""
